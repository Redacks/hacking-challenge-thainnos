Transposition ciphers rearrange the order of the letters in the plaintext to encrypt a message. In this task, you'll face a columnar transposition cipher. Your mission as a future white hat is to reorder chaos into clarity. Show us your analytical prowess by transforming jumbled letters into coherent text.
