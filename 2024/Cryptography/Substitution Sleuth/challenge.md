In the Simple Substitution Cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with a fixed shift in the alphabet. This challenge tests your pattern recognition and decryption abilities. As white hats preparing for the future, your ability to see through complex substitutions is key. Unravel the cipher and reveal the hidden message!

**Encrypted Text:**<br>
"BIUPZZWV{VSEVBPBSBPWZPVQSZ}"

**Hint:**<br>
In this substitution cipher, each letter in the alphabet is mapped to a different letter. Look for patterns in the ciphertext and consider common letter frequencies in English.
